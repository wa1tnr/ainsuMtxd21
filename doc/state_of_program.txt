On branch Hello_World_Conversations

The program prompts and responds - a very simple
interpreter that mostly echoes what you typed.

It understands one command, called 'warm' (as in
warm boot).

Pressing ENTER after typing 'warm' will cause the
program to warm reboot itself.

You'll know if it's about to work or not as there
is special typography to indicate that:

   warm  !warm!

The program is also a data dumper, but not a very
good one at this point.  Still trying to assess
where the program was at, on SAMD51.

This, however, should be a pretty good replica,
though the SAMD51 version probably has a much
faster system clock.
