On branch KM_converser_aa-

The program prints a memory dump with a leading hex
address in the first columns.

It then goes into interpreter mode, and can differentiate
an integer typed, from anything else (a string, pretty
much is the only other option).

No effort made to parse hexadecimal at this juncture.

The branch name is reused by sub-branching and merging.

    xKM_converser_aa-br-dd-  is the current working

developmental branch (its results are merged back into
branch KM_converser_aa- for consistency).

On branch Hello_World_Conversations

The program prompts and responds - a very simple
interpreter that mostly echoes what you typed.

It understands one command, called 'warm' (as in
warm boot).

Pressing ENTER after typing 'warm' will cause the
program to warm reboot itself.

You'll know if it's about to work or not as there
is special typography to indicate that:

   warm  !warm!

The program is also a data dumper, but not a very
good one at this point.  Still trying to assess
where the program was at, on SAMD51.

This, however, should be a pretty good replica,
though the SAMD51 version probably has a much
faster system clock.
