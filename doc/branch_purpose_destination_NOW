On branch xKM_converser_aa-br-cc-

See earlier entry for On branch xKM_converser_aa-br-bb-
which has the same purpose as this branch does, only
it's a bit earlier in sequence.

On branch xKM_converser_aa-br-bb-

This branch is meant to develop only the branch:

On branch KM_converser_aa-

Rather than pollute the namespace (for branches) with
a branch called 'KM_conv*' this branch follows a new
course: 

  The intent to merge with another branch that is
  not the master branch.

This way, development is more compartmentalized on
the short term; its result will be merged back into
an existing, well-named (heh) branch.

That's the idea.

TO THAT END, please refer to the 'base' branch of

          xKM_converser_aa-br-bb-

and do *not* bookmark this (very) branch (the xKM_ one)
as it is not meant to be permanent, but to provide only
for a short-term audit trail.

Its progress is meant to be reflected in the audit
trail for its parent (KM_converser_aa-).
