New branch instance:

    On branch Hello_Data_Dumper_factored_dd-

(see .._factored_cc- as well)

This program dumps a 32-bit integer, held in RAM,
to the UART (to the controlling serial terminal
attached to TX/RX pair at PA10/PA11).

It's dumped in context, for 16 bytes beginning
with the &variable.

Addresses not yet available to this interface. ;)

Serial port speed is 38400 bps.
